I am currently a post-doctoral research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I work at the Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC)- one of the largest research centers of its kind in the world with over 80 corporate sponsors, several graduate students, undergraduates and staff. 
I also got my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from WEMPEC in 2023.

My Ph.D. work focused on developing key-enablers in the form of power-dense electric drive systems to electrify off-highway vehicles. During my Ph.D. I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Eric Severson](https://severson.wempec.wisc.edu/) (I was his **first** Ph.D. student!) and a dynamic group of graduate students at WEMPEC on developing niche, weird, and cool electric machines, power electronics, and control.
The new knowledge that I created and the technology that I developed thus far is not just limited to off-highway vehicle electrification, but is directly applicable to _land transportation (electric vehicles), sustainable energy generation systems, magnetically levitated motor systems, fly-wheel energy storage, battery energy storage, robotic manipulators, and aircraft electrification_. 

My future research develops **key-enablers** for electrification, robotics, and sustainable energy systems, with a particular _soft spot_ at the **intersection of electric machine design, power electronics, and control**. My research is highly **inter-disciplinary** and heavily involves elements from the domains of wide-bandgap semiconductors, multi-physics analysis and design, design optimization, topology optimization, electro-hydraulic systems, applied and physics-based machine learning, material science, and metal aditive manufacturing.
