I am currently a post-doctoral research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I work at the Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC)- one of the largest research centers of its kind in the world with over 80 corporate sponsors, several graduate students, undergraduates and staff. 

I also got my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from WEMPEC in 2023, under the mentorship of [Prof. Eric Severson](https://severson.wempec.wisc.edu/) (I was his **first** student!). My Ph.D. work focused on developing **key-enablers** in the form of power-dense electric drive systems to electrify off-highway vehicles.

My research interests are at the **intersection of electric machine design, power electronics, and control**. I also have research interests in the allied domains of multi-physics analysis, robotic actuators, design optimization, topology optimization, electro-hydraulic systems, applied machine learning, and metal aditive manufacturing. 
The new knowledge that I created and the technology that I developed thus far is not just limited to off-highway vehicle electrification, but is directly applicable to _land transportation (electric vehicles), sustainable energy generation systems, fly-wheel energy storage, battery energy storage, robotic manipulators, and aircraft electrification_.
